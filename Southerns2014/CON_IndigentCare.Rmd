## Introduction

- Certificate-of-need (CON) programs prohibit hospitals, 
nursing homes, and ambulatory surgical centers from entering 
new markets or making changes to the existing capacity of 
medical facilities without first gaining approval from 
certificate-of-need regulators.

- As of 2011, 36 states and the District of Columbia had 
a CON program.


## Why grant monopoly privileges?

- The original justification for these laws was that CON 
programs would be able to control health care costs. 
Competition induces hospitals to over-invest in capacity, 
and regulators could lower costs by only granting needed 
investments.  

- Early economic literature on the topic overwhelmingly 
showed no evidence of lower costs. Econ 101!

- The modern argument is that supply restrictions create
monopoly profits and that with regulation, regulators can 
induce hospitals to cross-subsidize health care for the 
poor. 

## Estimation Strategy

We estimate the following model, 

$$ health care capacity_{st} = \alpha(CON_{st})+ \delta X_{st} + \vartheta _{t} + \varepsilon _{st} $$

$$ Indigent care_{st} = \alpha(CON_{st})+ \delta X_{st} + \vartheta _{t} + \varepsilon _{st} $$

## Data
Healthcare Cost Report Information System (HCRIS)

Hospital level data that we aggregate to form state 
level observations for 2007 through 2010.

HCRIS defines uncompensated care as the sum of charity care and bad debt.

American Hospital Association (AHA) sources: Hospital Statistics 2013 and the AHA subsidiary Health Forumâ€™s Medicaid statistics. We glean two indirect measures of indigent care: ratios of Medicaid patient days to total patient days and of Medicaid admissions to total patient discharges

Certificate-of-need program data come from our third source, the American Health Planning Association (AHPA). The AHPA publishes its annual survey of state CON programs in annual national directories. From these directories we assembled the most comprehensive dataset on state CON regulations to date, covering 1992 through 2011.
