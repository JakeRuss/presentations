Washington, D.C. -  U.S. Congressman Kevin Brady, who led the successful three-year effort to pass the Central American Free Trade Agreement, issued the following statement today after being named Ranking Member (lead Republican) of the House Ways & Means Subcommittee on Trade.“The freedom for American farmers, businesses and workers to sell their products throughout the world is key to our economic recovery. Rather than retreat from trade, I am going to urge our government to aggressively level the playing field in the global marketplace. We need jobs and we need families to have the widest choices of affordable products to stretch their pocketbook.”Trade is related to 2.2 million jobs in Texas, which is the largest exporting state in the nation. Brady will also continue to serve on the Ways & Means Social Security Sub-committee and as Lead House Republican on the Joint Economic Committee.
