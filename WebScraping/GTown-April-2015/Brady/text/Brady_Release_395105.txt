Washington, D.C. - The United States has been losing jobs for 12 straight months now according to new figures released this morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last month, another 524,000 jobs were lost bringing the total to about 2.6 million jobs. With this sobering news as a background, Congressman Kevin Brady, the Senior House Republican on the Joint Economic Committee, issued the following statement:“These job losses confirm a profound lack of confidence in the economy by both families who are restraining their spending and businesses who are doing the same with investment.I am not convinced that confidence can be restored with a massive ‘borrow and spend” binge by Congress, especially since the federal government is already overspending its budget by more than a trillion dollars this year. We watched Japan try the same thing and their economy floundered for a decade. If the American public and the business community sense that lawmakers in Washington are seriously addressing the fundamental problems with the economy rather than relying on yet another bag of rebate gimmicks and social spending, then they will respond.”
