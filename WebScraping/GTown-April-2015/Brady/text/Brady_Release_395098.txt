Washington, D.C. - Congressman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) released the following statement after the Democrat-led U.S. House of Representatives voted to release another $350 billion dollars in bailout funds, now called the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Brady, the senior House Republican on the Joint Economic Committee, voted not to release the second half of the bail out dollars. "I've been disappointed, to say the least, with the results and accountability of the first bail out funds.“I understand the need for flexibility, but Congress initially approved a very different plan from what those first monies were actually used for.  Amazingly, today there are still no specifics on how the remaining $350 billion will be spent to truly stem this financial crisis. So I say ‘no plan, no money.’“My advice to the new Treasury Department is simple: define the problem. The reason banks and businesses are hoarding their cash is that everyone knows a second wave of mortgage and commercial foreclosures will occur in this year and the next. Until our regulators force this problem to the surface quickly and address it head-on, credit markets will not be restored, here or abroad, and America’s economic recovery will be delayed further.”
