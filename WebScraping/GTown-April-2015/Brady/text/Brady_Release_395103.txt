                              Washington, D.C. - Congressman Kevin Brady's issued the following statement after voting no to expanding SCHIP: "I'm proud to have helped create the CHIP           share:          f           t                     Washington, D.C. - Congressman Kevin Brady’s issued the following statement after voting no to expanding SCHIP:"I’m proud to have helped create the CHIP program in 1997, because it’s great preventative medicine and has been a huge help to working families, but this expansion plan is just irresponsible. This bill before us today allows serious abuses to continue, does not focus on the poorest children first, and reverses a long-standing, bi-partisan ban against new immigrants enrolling in the program."Worst of all, Congress only partially funded this expansion, setting up an enormous balloon payment in five years that taxpayers will be hard pressed to pay for, especially middle-class families who are already doing without to make sure their children have health care."This is not the kind of change that Americans are looking for."
