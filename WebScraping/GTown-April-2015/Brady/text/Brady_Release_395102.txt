Washington, D.C. - “When Texans pick up the phone and say hello, they should not find a prisoner bent on threatening them on the other end of the call.” Congressman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) says that’s why he has introduced legislation in the House of Representatives to change the Federal Communications Commission code so the State of Texas can block illegal cellular phone calls from being made from inside Texas jails and prisons.  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison is introducing an identical bill in the Senate. “This legislation will fight criminal enterprises behind bars and protect innocent victims and public officials from harassment and threats from criminals,” said Sen. Hutchison.  “Recent cases of prisoners smuggling cell phones behind bars highlight the need to use current technology to prevent this ability.” Last year, prisoners on Texas’ death row were caught making threatening calls to the families of their victims, prosecutors, and elected officials on illegally obtained cell phones.  The state instituted a statewide prison lockdown to remove cell phones and other contraband from the prisons.  However, prison officials told Rep. Brady that federal law prohibited them from taking the next logical step of installing blocking devices in state prisons.  “I strongly urge my colleagues to get behind this legislation,” said Brady who has worked on this bill in connection with the FCC and various telecommunications committees. “It is unacceptable that these inmates have been able to threaten people from behind bars, and it must not continue.” The State of Texas has taken aggressive measures to remove all cellular phones from the prison inmates, but without this necessary change in federal law, they will never be able to stop all illegal calls.
