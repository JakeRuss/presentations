Washington, D.C. - Congressman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) is leading several of his Gulf Coast colleagues in asking Acting Commerce Secretary Otto J. Wolff to help Gulf Coast residents with a unique DTV transition problem.In the busy 2008 Hurricane season residents of Texas and Louisiana faced down a triple threat from the Gulf of Mexico: Dolly, Gustav and Ike. Many coastal residents who did the right thing and ordered their DTV Coupons early lost them when the hurricanes ravaged their homes or they never received them while living in temporary housing. “While these families count every penny as they try to rebuild, there should be a way we can all work together to replace these lost DTV coupons before the next hurricane season rolls around,” said Brady.Brady, who is asking the Acting Commerce Secretary to take immediate steps to prioritize coupon delivery and replacement for residents of hurricane impacted regions, added “while we are sensitive to the backlog of coupon applications, coastal residents who rely on their televisions for crucial weather alerts should not be left in the cold because of lost or never received DTV coupons.”
