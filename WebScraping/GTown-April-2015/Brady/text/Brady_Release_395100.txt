Washington, D.C. - Congressman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) congratulated dozens of communities in District 8 Texas that were awarded the “Picturing America” Award from the National Endowment for the Humanities.“This innovative program will give our students the opportunity to learn about our great national history through American art and masterpieces. I am extremely excited to see that so many of our schools across Texas were eligible for this program and now will have the opportunity to incorporate such a great teaching tool into their curriculum,” said Brady.Picturing America is an educational program composed of forty, specifically selected works of art spanning several centuries. All of these works are done by American painters, sculptors, photographers, and architects. These works are reproduced in the highest quality resolution and distributed to the eligible schools with teacher resource books, lesson plans, and supporting materials.In order to receive these materials schools across America had the opportunity to submit an application requesting to be included in the program. Overall approximately 76,000 schools in the United States have been grated the materials to include in their lesson plans. In Texas alone 4,127 schools are participating in this program and that number is growing after every application cycle.
