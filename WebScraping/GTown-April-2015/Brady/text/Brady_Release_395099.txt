Washington, D.C. - Congressman Kevin Brady released the following statement after getting word from the White House that Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean were going to be released:“These officers have served enough time for the mistakes they made and I thank President Bush for giving these officers their freedom back by commuting their excessive sentences to time served. No law enforcement officer should ever fear an enhanced handgun sentencing guidelines being used against them over a split-second, line of duty decision.”
